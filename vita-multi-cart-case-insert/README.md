# Vita Multi-Cart Case Insert

An insert for vita game cases to hold 6 more game carts in the extra space around the main cart holder.

I got some used games that came without a case and I wanted somewhere to put them where I wouldn't lose them.

Print in PETG (or something else with a similar amount of flex) at 0.15 mm layer height or less. I haven't tested this, but I expect that PLA would be too brittle for the clips. It would still mostly work, but you'd probably lose the clips pretty quick.
