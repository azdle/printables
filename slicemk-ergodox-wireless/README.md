This is a case for for the [SliceMK ErgoDox Wireless](https://www.slicemk.com/pages/ergodox-wireless). This design has been tested with the v1, but there doesn't appear to be any changes to the v2 that would affect the case.

NOTE: This isn't quite a perfect fit, I'd like to make it better but after 9 iterations of trying, I can't be bothered to do any more right now. I've had lots of trouble getting the measurements of the corners exactly right.
