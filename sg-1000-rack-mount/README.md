# Netgate SG-1000 Firewall Rack Mount

I'm starting working on mounting all my (non-rack-sized) networking equipment in the side of my rack to get it out of the way for new rack-sized things.

This vertically mounts an SG-1000 to any standard server rack. I've used it on the side, should just work the face of the rack too.


## Parts Needed

* 1x M2x6 Screw
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts
