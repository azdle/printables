I'm starting working on mounting all my (non-rack-sized) networking equipment in the side of my rack to get it out of the way for new rack-sized things.

# Netgate SG-1000 Firewall Rack Mount

This vertically mounts an SG-1000 to any standard server rack. I've used it on the side, should just work the face of the rack too.

## Parts Needed

* 1x M2x6 Screw
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts

# Netgear Switch Rack Mount

This mounts a Netgear GS108PEv3 8-Port PoE Switch using the pair of mounting holes on the back. It, unfortunately, orients the switch in the one direction where the mount doesn't key, but it seems to be holding it just fine none the less. If it works right with your setup, you should mirror this part so it mounts the direction it was meant to.

## Parts Needed

* 2x Included Wall Mount Screws
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts
