These are mounts that mount my networking equipment on the *side* of my rack. My rack has standard rack nut squares down the side, 90 degrees off the front, that I use to mount these brackets. If you use this on the standard front or back mounting positions you'll end up with these devices sitting across the face (or back) of your rack.

# APU Rack Mount

This mounts a PCEngines APU2 standard enclosure to any standard server rack pattern.

## Printing Instructions

Print one normally and optionally print a second mirrored across the shorter dimension for the other side for a stronger mount. You might only be able to fit a single cage screw on the second side.

## Parts Needed (Per Print)

* 2x Screws to mate to enclosure (I don't remember the size)
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts


# Netgate SG-1000 Firewall Rack Mount

This mounts a Netgate SG-1000 to any standard server rack.

## Parts Needed

* 1x M2x6 Screw
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts

# Netgear Switch Rack Mount

This mounts a Netgear GS108PEv3 8-Port PoE Switch using the pair of mounting holes on the back. It, unfortunately, orients the switch in the one direction where the mount doesn't key, but it seems to be holding it just fine none the less. If it works right with your setup, you should mirror this part so it mounts the direction it was meant to.

## Parts Needed

* 2x Included Wall Mount Screws
* 2x M5/6 Cage Screws & Nuts
